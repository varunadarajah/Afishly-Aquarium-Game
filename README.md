## Abstract
Comfy Aquarium is a 2D idle-style IOS game designed for players to unwind and relieve stress. The app was built on the Unity game engine and scripted in C#, with fellow CSSE major Anthony Vu as co-developer. This project was done in conjunction with an Interactive Media Design (IMD) capstone group consisting of Spencer Jong, Hanyue Shi, and Spencer Pruitt, who provided all the designs, assets, and requirements for the game. They had created the initial designs for the game but were in need of developers to actualize it, which they enlisted us to do.

The primary goal of this project was to implement the Comfy Aquarium game and meet the requirements of the IMD group within the one-quarter time constraint, while also practicing software engineering and game design principles to create an appealing and intuitive final product.

At the end of the project, we were able to create a fully functional version of the game with the primary requested features implemented, such as the core pearl mechanics, fish shop, inventory, and decoration system. The app is compatible with both iPhone and iPad devices through its adaptive UI. There were some desired features, like the IOS home screen widget, that were not feasible to complete during the project.

Through working on this project, I gained valuable experience working on a larger team project. I had to collaborate closely with co-developer Anthony Vu to properly implement different components of the game, as well as routinely meet and communicate with the IMD group to ensure we were on schedule and meeting their requirements. As we had minimal experience working with Unity at the beginning of the project, we struggled with how to organize ourselves and best implement features of the game. But by the end, I learned how to effectively utilize the features of Unity to implement our game, and acquired knowledge in game design through building modular and expandable components and getting user feedback to create an enjoyable and intuitive experience.
